<h3>Disabilities in Context</h3>
<p1>Establishing our social justice issue, treatment of the disabled community in Israel, through research.</p1>
 <br>
 <br>
     <p2> <h4>Introduction:</h4> 


In Israel, 5% of adults suffer from severe cognitive or physical disabilities (another 16% of adults have moderate to mild disabilities) making treatment of disabled a prevalent issue in Israel. After persistent widespread complaint concerning the inadequate treatment of disabled Israelis, the government has begun to make efforts and build plans to further support the disabled community in Israel. Many journalists have written articles concerning both next steps, holes, and progress in Israel's treatment of disabled people.
<br>
<br>
<h5>As reported by JDC Israel Unlimited:</h5>
Israel's war torn history has had many effects on Israeli society one of which is the increased population of disabled citizens. With many people to take care of and limited funding, the Israeli government has had past troubles taking care of all of their disabled residents. Israel has to maximize the use of their resources and build a sustainable plan to take care of their disabled residents for the future. In this report of Israel's current status on the topic of treatment of disabled, JDC Israel Unlimited exposes Israel's current treatment of disabled people. This extensive analyzation boils down to one main thought. Although Israel has made great legislative progress and has managed to make many physical improvements in accessibility and other core issues and therefore has succeeded in promoting the involvement of disabled in Israel's general community, Israel still has to focus on integrating Israel's disabled community with the rest of the Israeli population.
<br>
         <br>
Evidence in form of quotations -
         <br>
		-"The Convention's implementation requires changes in the legislation and regulations regarding guardianship for people with disabilities and their right to independent living and independent housing in the community."
         <br>
		-"The most prevalent disability types are physical (17.5%) and mental health (9.2%).24 See the percentages of different disability types in Diagram 1."
         <br>
		-"The State of Israel provides services to children and adults with
physical, sensory, mental health and intellectual disabilities. In recent years, Israel ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and legislation has been passed to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in the community. However, despite these developments, much still needs to be done in order to better integrate people with disabilities into all aspects of Israeli life and to help them realize their full potential. Our hope is that the information presented here will help to clarify
and focus attention on the remaining challenges and assist in the efforts to address them."
<br>
<br>
<h5>As reported by ALEH:</h5>
Started by Major General (Res.) Doron Almog, the idea of ALEH was inspired by the poor treatment of Major General (Res.) Doron Almog's son, Eran, a severely disabled boy. ALEH represents a solution to not only the treatment of severely disabled in Israel but also racial, religious, and economic segregation. In dedicating ALEH Negev to Major General (Res.) Doron Almog's past son, Eran, Major General (Res.) Almog illustrates the struggle in building human connections and helping "normal people" understand that disabled are not "others" as everybody adds a distinct spark to this world. 
<br>
         <br>
Evidence in form of quotations -
         <br>
		-"He needs to constantly be watched to make sure no one hits him or hurts him. After all, he can’t tell us if he is abused. He can’t complain. At best, he will smile as an expression of his thanks."
         <br>
         -"The fifth test was the challenge of challenging him.... The sixth test was the challenge of increasing function ability."
         <br>
		-"Yet at the same time, these are the children who are the most vulnerable. These were the children who are denied freedom of choice.... They are the hostages against whom we measure the quality of kindness within each of us."
<br>
<br>

<h5>As reported by the Jewish Virtual Library:</h5>

In reading the official law passed by Israeli legislation, The Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law, 5758-1998, one is exposed to the legislative challenges that the Israeli government is faced with in creating a more equal [specifically in terms of the treatment of severely disabled] state. These challenges primarily revolve around three fundamental areas, accessibility of public resources, realistic employment and the physical promotion of equal rights between disabled and non-disabled. 
<br>
         <br>
Evidence in form of quotations -
         <br>
		-"[T]o correct a prior or existing discrimination against people
with disabilities or designed to advance the equality of people with disabilities
shall not be regarded as unlawful discrimination."
         <br>
		-"An employer shall not discriminate between his employees or persons seeking employment, by reason of their disabilities..."
         <br>
		-"A person with disabilities is entitled to public transportation
services which are accessible and appropriate for his use..."

<br>
<br>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
From credible publications such as 1st source, 2nd source, 3rd source, one can distinctly
see that in Israel - as in many other countries - figuring out ways to treat and support the severely disabled community is extremely challenging from an economic perspective and in changing societal views. Israel must investigate ways to grow government partnerships with private institutions where the not only financial support is given but were severely disabled are integrated into the lives of ordinary citizens.
