    <h2>How I came across this issue</h2>
      <h3>My story of connection to the disabled community and their struggles.</h3>
    <p>
        <br>
        It is said that a society and a people shall be measured by how they treat their most vulnerable, including their most disabled, people like my cousin, Dylan, of blessed memory. Three years ago my cousin, Dylan, passed away at the age of six due to his severe disabilities. He was the purest, kindest, happiest person I had ever met and will ever meet. He taught me the most anyone has ever offered, all without ever speaking a word or motioning with his body. Still, he taught me how to be gracious, selfless, optimistic, and most importantly he taught me the value of happiness. 
        <br>
      
Unfortunately, throughout the world today, a true commitment towards working to improve the lives of the disabled is widely lacking. Far too often, our own countries, Israel included, fall short in providing our disabled brethren the love and support they need so that they may be properly cared for.  The world is leaving its most helpless citizens behind.
        <br>  
      
        I strongly believe that every life is a valued life and that every person, no matter their disposition, deserves to have the opportunities to develop into their best selves and live life as fully as possible, and as the world takes advantage of its helpless citizens, I refuse to standby and simply watch. 
        <br>
      
In Israel, limited government support is available to the severely disabled community and what resources are given are continuously overused. This lack of generosity to Israel's disabled community has left and will continue to leave severely disabled in the shadow of the rest of the country. 
        <br>
       
This is not an issue of race or creed. This is a moral issue. An issue of humans being treated unhumanly. It is time for us all to gather and fight for the dignity of the people who are unable to fight for themselves. We can all help by raising awareness and supporting individual organizations in Israel who need our support and resources to continue to fight hard for those who need it the most.
